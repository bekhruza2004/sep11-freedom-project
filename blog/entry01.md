## Content

For my Freedom Project I decided to use Phaser which is a JavaScript framework for making games. I chose Phaser because it’s for beginners but still good enough to create games like platformers which is the type of game I want to make. I tinkered with the code by testing code from the Phaser documentation and changing parts of the code to see what would happen. For example, I changed how the camera follows the player and experimented with animation frame rates to make the movement look smoother or faster.

## Sources

The main source I used to learn Phaser was the [Phaser Documentation](https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser).

## EDP

Right now I am at the research the problem stage of the engineering design process. I’ve been looking at how Phaser works and what features it offers for making a platformer. My next step will be to brainstorm the possible solutions where I will try to make something and decide what assets and controls my game will need.

## Skills

For logical reasoning I had to think carefully about how each part of the code connects. For example, if the player moves off the screen then the camera needs to follow. This helped me understand cause and effect in my code. For debugging I practiced testing small code changes to fix problems. Sometimes I had typos or forgot to preload a sprite.
